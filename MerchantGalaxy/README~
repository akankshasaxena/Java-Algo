Merchant's Guide to the Galaxy

Design Specification & Assumption -

This program contains two main reusable modules , First converts from Roman to Number. This is done by using Map interface which holds the basic conversion between Roman Numerals & Integer Numbers. This is acheived by using TreeMap whose capability of providing sort on values is used. A ValueComparator class is been created which implements the logic of sorting.
Second problem of conversion from intergalactia units to Integer is acheived by creating another module which inherently calls first module. Second module is a 2 step process in which firstly intergalactia units are converted into Roman and then roman and metal currency converted into equavalent number(credits).

Assumptions - 
roman equivalent text would not occur after mentioning Metal Name.
like glob glob Silver glob is a invalid string for conversion.


How To Run-
1) - Compile the Classes -
	javac ValueComparator.java MerchantGalaxy.java 
2) - A test file named as Test is provided within the project which contains test inputs.
3) - This programs can be run from command prompt either by specifying the file like below :

	java MerchantGalaxy < Test

4) - or Giving the direct input from command line after running following command, Each line will be terminated by pressing Enter , after which the result will be displayed:

	java MerchantGalaxy
